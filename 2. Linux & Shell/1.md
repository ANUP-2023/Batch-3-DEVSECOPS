**IPV4 & IPV6: Understanding IP Addresses**

### IPV4

#### 1. IP Address Representation:
   - Decimal Notation: 255.255.255.255
   - Binary Notation: 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111

#### 2. Binary to Decimal Conversion:
   - Binary: 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111
   - Decimal: 255.255.255.255

#### 3. Subnetting:
   - Subnet: 10.2.11.32
   - Binary: 00001010.00000010.00001011.00100000
   - Decimal: 10.2.11.32
   - Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.224 (CIDR /27)
   - Subnet Range: 10.2.11.0 to 10.2.11.31

### IPV6

#### 1. IPV6 Address:
   - IPV6 addresses are 128 bits long, represented in hexadecimal separated by colons.

### CIDR Notation:

#### 1. CIDR for IPV4:
   - CIDR Notation: 10.0.0.0/16
   - Range: 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255 (256*256 addresses)

#### 2. CIDR for Subnetting:
   - Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24
     - Range: 10.0.1.0 to 10.0.1.255
   - Subnet: 10.0.2.0/24
     - Range: 10.0.2.0 to 10.0.2.255
   - Subnet: 10.0.3.0/24
     - Range: 10.0.3.0 to 10.0.3.255

# Networking Concepts:

### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It provides logically isolated sections of the AWS Cloud where you can launch resources. Key aspects of VPC include:

#### Example:

Let's create a VPC with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16:

```plaintext
VPC: 10.0.0.0/16
```

### Subnetting:

Subnetting involves dividing a large network into smaller, manageable sub-networks or subnets. Subnets are created within a VPC and allow you to segment resources based on use case or security requirements.

#### Example:

Within the VPC, let's create two subnets:

```plaintext
Subnet 1: 10.0.1.0/24
Subnet 2: 10.0.2.0/24
```

### Security Group:

A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic. It allows or denies traffic based on rules defined for the security group.

#### Example:

Create a security group for a web server allowing HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22) traffic:

```plaintext
Security Group:
  - Inbound Rule: Allow traffic on port 80 (HTTP)
  - Inbound Rule: Allow traffic on port 22 (SSH)
```

### Route Table:

A Route Table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed. Each subnet in a VPC must be associated with a route table. A default route table is automatically created when you create a VPC.

#### Example:

Create a route table with a route to an internet gateway for public subnets:

```plaintext
Route Table:
  - Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
    Target: Internet Gateway
```

### Ports:

Ports are logical constructs that represent specific communication endpoints in networking. They allow different services on the same device to utilize network resources without interference.

#### Example:

Suppose you have an EC2 instance in Subnet 1 running a web server. The Security Group associated with it allows traffic on port 80 (HTTP).

```plaintext
EC2 Instance (Subnet 1):
  - IP: 10.0.1.10
  - Security Group: Allow Inbound on port 80

Access the web server at http://10.0.1.10
```

### Conclusion:

Understanding and configuring VPCs, subnets, security groups, route tables, and ports are essential for designing a secure and scalable network architecture in the cloud. The examples provided illustrate the basic configurations, but real-world scenarios may involve more complex setups and additional considerations based on specific use cases and security requirements.
