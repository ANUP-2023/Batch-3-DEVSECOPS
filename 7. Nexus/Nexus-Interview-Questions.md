11. **Explain the concept of Nexus 3 repositories as code using Groovy scripts.**
    - **Answer:** Nexus 3 allows you to manage repositories and their configurations using Groovy scripts. This enables the definition of repositories as code, making it easier to version, share, and manage configurations.

### Artifact Lifecycle:

12. **What is the process for deleting artifacts from Nexus 3?**
    - **Answer:** Deleting artifacts in Nexus 3 can be done manually through the UI or programmatically using the Nexus REST API. It's important to consider the impact on dependencies and the repository configuration.

13. **Explain how Nexus 3 handles artifact cleanup.**
    - **Answer:** Nexus 3 provides cleanup policies that automatically remove artifacts based on criteria such as last downloaded date, snapshot retention, and more. These policies help manage storage space efficiently.

### Security Best Practices:

14. **What are some security best practices for Nexus 3?**
    - **Answer:** Best practices include setting up fine-grained access control, regularly updating Nexus, securing communication using SSL, using strong authentication mechanisms, and monitoring security advisories.

15. **How can you secure Docker repositories in Nexus 3?**
    - **Answer:** Securing Docker repositories involves using HTTPS, enforcing user authentication, and setting up token-based authentication for Docker clients.

### Advanced Configuration:

16. **Explain how Nexus 3 supports multi-datacenter setups.**
    - **Answer:** Nexus 3 supports multi-datacenter setups through features like Blob Stores that allow you to store artifacts on shared storage. Clustering can also be used for high availability and load balancing.

17. **What are Nexus 3 Smart Proxy repositories?**
    - **Answer:** Smart Proxy repositories in Nexus 3 enable efficient mirroring of artifacts across different instances of Nexus, reducing the load on the central repository.

### Troubleshooting:

18. **How do you troubleshoot Nexus 3 if it's not starting?**
    - **Answer:** Check Nexus logs for error messages, verify Java and system requirements, review configuration files, and ensure that required ports are available.

19. **What steps would you take if Nexus 3 is running out of disk space?**
    - **Answer:** Review the storage usage, clean up unnecessary artifacts, configure cleanup policies, and consider expanding the storage capacity.

### Best Practices for Performance:

20. **What are some best practices for optimizing Nexus 3 performance?**
    - **Answer:** Best practices include optimizing JVM settings, using SSDs for storage, configuring Nexus blob stores appropriately, and using a content delivery network (CDN) for proxy repositories.

These questions cover various aspects of Nexus 3, from basic concepts to more advanced configurations and troubleshooting scenarios. Keep in mind that the answers may vary based on specific versions and configurations. It's essential to refer to the official Nexus Repository Manager documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
